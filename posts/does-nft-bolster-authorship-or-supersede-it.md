I've been thinking about what NFT means for authorship and I think it does overall benefit the goal of undermining authorship/copyright by essentially the sale of the work is also all rights attributable to the work copyright is actually not a par o f the equation at all e.g. a beeple painting, its freely copied and reposted because all the value is now attributed to the ownership of the token. no one cares about screenshotting it

NFT extends and formalizes authorship via the blockhain ledger, however NFT also undermines authorship, by flattening it onto ownership. Original creator is a devalued meta tag, what is made important is ownership rights -- which, importantly, are not COPY rights.

So the question of authorrhip really only comes at the stage of minting, who has the right to mint the jpeg and sell it? This is something abritrated indirectly by the TOS of markets like open seas

It at the end of the day they're just meta protocols, and if it exists on the chain it exits regardless who chooses to list it on this meta markets; it ends up being determined solely by market -- if the true creator of the meme intervened and mints it with proofs they're the true creator, they'd presumably devalue the existing NFT as a retroactive "forgery"
