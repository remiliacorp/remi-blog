### Market sale structure

First edition release of 300 as a semi-fungible token on auction, with both the token and a physical book delivered to every buyer. The first book sales in the thousands of dollars; and a question of after market valuations - will the physical book (the "original" NFT) become more valuable, or the NFT, or will they track identically?

Afterwards, an infinite edition print-on-demand physical release at-cost price.
