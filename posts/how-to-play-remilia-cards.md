players use a continuous resource form called 'agency,' starting out at X amount, which is decreased by the cards they have on the field, according to their agency costs. agency-generating cards exist, even those that do not have any agency cost of their own, nor are there limits on how many cards can be played per turn. The trick is that the effects on each card are so ridiculous that both indulgence -- trying to play as much as one can in a vain attempt to overwhelm -- and restraint -- being a little calculating faggot -- can be adequately punished by either player. 

Of course, this is not a real game, it merely assumes the form of one, and agency as a term within game mechanics is ambiguous enough to denote both a cost and power resource; every piece on the field with agency ascribed to them directly is detrimental to the player's own agency, perfidious as the forces are they harness: a player's agency represents their resistance to hostile forces, and for each attack of influence (a monster or other source its power) on the player that would reduce their agency that turn below zero, points of damage are taken according to the amount of influence that surpassed it. if an X amount of damage is taken, the player loses the game. 

Thus, by wielding powerful forces on the field, a player lowers their own agency and consequently puts themselves at greater risk. 

Monsters, aside from having agency and influence, have resistance as a defense resource, which can be used to block another player's monsters in combat, same as mtg, attacking player selects monsters to attack with, defending player selects monsters to block those with, monsters deal damage to each other depending on influence and are removed from the game if resistance is exceeded, but excess influence from the attacker will always pass through the defending monster and attack the defending player. This is a brief summary of the imaginary fundamentals which allow me to think up a couple designs.
