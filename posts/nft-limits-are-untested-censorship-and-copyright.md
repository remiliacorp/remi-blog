There has not been a banned NFT yet. What does it mean to ban an NFT, anyway? You can violate the guidelines of the exclusive marketplaces (Rarible, Nifty), who may decide to unlist your controversial work or even punish you by blacklisting you from their group. 

Then there's the Terms of Service of the open, meta-markets such as Open Sea, who similarly may delist you. Open Sea, for example, explicitly disallows non-artistic NSFW content (determined by their discretion). 

But all support the standard ETH chain with NFT's minted on their shared protocol. They can only manually intervene based on subjective determination. Open Sea cannot even do anything about an NFT already minted and sold through their platform, there is no way for them to "recall" it.

What if an Anarchist's NFT was to be minted, and "universally" banned by the major markets? I'm not sure if there's a platform for direct p2p NFT sales, but one could whip up a demo site in a day if needed. Realistically, it would be easy enough to duplicate Open Sea entirely with their open-source SDK if necessary, to create a market for Banned NFT's, either one peddling in exclusively Banned NFT's, or a secondary backup to Open Sea that ignores the banned items.

And what do we do about that banned NFT, existing on the blockchain? It's not like the community is all going to take a vote to fork ETH chain just to remove it. What if it's something genuinely illegal, like classified documents or CP? What if it's just Mickey Mouse, and Disney doesn't like that. Is the No-Censorship Open Sea backup held liable for letting Mickey Mouse NFT sale on their platform, is that a violation of copyright?

These questions haven't been tested yet, but they could easily be. Perhaps let's start with Mickey Mouse.
